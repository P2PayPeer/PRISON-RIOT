# Monitoring Equipment: Advanced surveillance technology such as CCTV cameras, motion detectors, and audio recording devices used by guards to monitor the entire prison complex. 
#      This equipment allows them to identify potential threats, assess situations, and coordinate responses to incidents.

# Communication Systems: Two-way radios, intercoms, and computer terminals connecting guards at different posts enabling real-time communication and coordination. 
#      These tools facilitate the swift dissemination of information and ensure timely response to emergencies.

# Weapons Cache: Secured areas containing firearms, batons, pepper spray, and other non-lethal weapons used by guards to maintain order and protect themselves in dangerous situations.

# First Aid Kits: Basic medical supplies and equipment stored in each guard post for treating minor injuries sustained by guards or inmates during altercations or accidents.

# Security Doors/Barriers: Physical barriers like turnstiles, gates, and doors that control access to specific areas of the prison, ensuring only authorized personnel can enter sensitive locations.

# Emergency Buttons/Alarms: Similar to those found throughout the prison, guard posts feature alarms that can be triggered in cases of emergencies or security breaches, summoning immediate assistance from nearby personnel.


# Cameras: As with other locations in the prison, guard posts may have hidden cameras capturing footage of all activity taking place within their vicinity. 
#       This provides an additional layer of accountability and helps deter misconduct among both guards and inmates.

# Building rapport and trust with security personnel can lead to valuable information, resource access, and potentially even alliances. 
# However, crossing lines or drawing undue attention to oneself could result in consequences ranging from loss of privileges to escalated conflict within the prison walls.
