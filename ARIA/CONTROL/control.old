# Guard Posts/Control Rooms Inventory & Function Index:

# Monitoring Equipment: Advanced surveillance technology such as CCTV cameras, motion detectors, and audio recording devices used by guards to monitor the entire prison complex. This equipment allows them to identify potential threats, assess situations, and coordinate responses to incidents.
# Communication Systems: Two-way radios, intercoms, and computer terminals connecting guards at different posts enabling real-time communication and coordination. These tools facilitate the swift dissemination of information and ensure timely response to emergencies.
# Weapons Cache: Secured areas containing firearms, batons, pepper spray, and other non-lethal weapons used by guards to maintain order and protect themselves in dangerous situations.
# First Aid Kits: Basic medical supplies and equipment stored in each guard post for treating minor injuries sustained by guards or inmates during altercations or accidents.
# Rest Facilities: Small sleeping quarters or break areas provided for guards on duty, allowing them to rest briefly without compromising their ability to respond promptly to emergencies.
# Security Doors/Barriers: Physical barriers like turnstiles, gates, and doors that control access to specific areas of the prison, ensuring only authorized personnel can enter sensitive locations.
# Emergency Buttons/Alarms: Similar to those found throughout the prison, guard posts feature alarms that can be triggered in cases of emergencies or security breaches, summoning immediate assistance from nearby personnel.
# Cameras: As with other locations in the prison, guard posts may have hidden cameras capturing footage of all activity taking place within their vicinity. This provides an additional layer of accountability and helps deter misconduct among both guards and inmates.

# In dealing with guards stationed at these posts, players must navigate a delicate balance between cooperation and subversion.
# Building rapport and trust with security personnel can lead to valuable information, resource access, and potentially even alliances. 
# However, crossing lines or drawing undue attention to oneself could result in consequences ranging from loss of privileges to escalated conflict within the prison walls.
